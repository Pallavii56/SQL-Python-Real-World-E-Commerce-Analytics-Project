## 🧠 Sample SQL Queries

### 📅 Monthly Revenue Analysis

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(order_purchase_timestamp, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    SUM(payment_value) AS revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN payments p ON o.order_id = p.order_id
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

### 🏆 Top Products by Revenue

```sql
SELECT 
    product_id,
    SUM(price) AS revenue
FROM order_items
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
